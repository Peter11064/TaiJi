	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>The concept of the taiji <em>("supreme ultimate")</em>, in contrast with wuji <em>("without ultimate")</em>, appears in both Taoist and Confucian Chinese philosophy, where it represents the fusion or mother[2] of yin and yang into a single ultimate, represented by the taijitu symbol Taijitu - &#9775. T‘ai-chi ch‘üan theory and practice evolved in agreement with many Chinese philosophical principles, including those of Taoism and Confucianism.</p>
	<p>T‘ai-chi ch‘üan training involves five elements, taolu (solo hand and weapons routines/forms), <b>neigong</b> and <b>qigong</b> (breathing, movement and awareness exercises and meditation), <b>tuishou</b> (response drills) and <b>sanshou</b> (self defence techniques). While t‘ai-chi ch‘üan is typified by some for its slow movements, many t‘ai-chi styles (including the three most popular — Yang, Wu and Chen) have secondary forms with faster pace. Some traditional schools of t‘ai-chi teach partner exercises known as <b>tuishou</b> (pushing hands), and martial applications of the postures of different forms <em>(taolu)</em>.</p>
	<p>In China, t‘ai-chi ch‘üan is categorized under the <em>Wudang</em> grouping of Chinese martial arts[3]—that is, the <i>arts applied with internal power.</i>[4] Although the term Wudang suggests these arts originated in the Wudang Mountains, it is simply used to distinguish the skills, theories and applications of <em>neijia</em> (internal arts) from those of the Shaolin grouping, or <em>waijia</em> (hard or external) styles.[5]</p>
	<p>Since the earliest widespread promotion of the health benefits of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan, by <i class="name">Yang Shaohou</i>, <i class="name">Yang Chengfu</i>, <i class="name">Wu Chien-ch‘üan</i> and <i class="name">Sun Lutang</i> in the early 20th century,[6] it has developed a worldwide following of people, often with little or no interest in martial training, for its benefit to personal health.[7] Medical studies of t‘ai-chi support its effectiveness as an alternative exercise and a form of martial arts therapy.</p>
	<p>It is purported that focusing the mind solely on the movements of the form helps to bring about a state of mental calm and clarity. Besides general health benefits and stress management attributed to t‘ai-chi ch‘üan training, aspects of traditional Chinese medicine are taught to advanced t‘ai-chi ch‘üan students in some traditional schools.[8]</p>
	<p>Some other forms of martial arts require students to wear a uniform during practice. In general, t‘ai-chi ch‘üan schools do not require a uniform, but both traditional and modern teachers often advocate loose, comfortable clothing and flat-soled shoes.[9][10]</p>
	<p>The physical techniques of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan are described in the <cite>"T‘ai-chi classics,"</cite> a set of writings by traditional masters, as being characterized by the use of leverage through the joints based on coordination and relaxation, rather than muscular tension, in order to neutralize, yield or initiate attacks. The slow, repetitive work involved in the process of learning how that leverage is generated gently and measurably increases, opens the internal circulation (breath, body heat, blood, lymph, peristalsis, etc.).</p>
	<p>The study of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan primarily involves three aspects:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Health: An unhealthy or otherwise uncomfortable person may find it difficult to meditate to a state of calmness or to use t‘ai-chi ch‘üan as a martial art. T‘ai-chi ch‘üan's health training, therefore, concentrates on relieving the physical effects of stress on the body and mind. For those focused on t‘ai-chi ch‘üan's martial application, good physical fitness is an important step towards effective self-defense.</li>
	<li>Meditation: The focus and calmness cultivated by the meditative aspect of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan is seen as necessary in maintaining optimum health (in the sense of relieving stress and maintaining homeostasis) and in application of the form as a soft style martial art.</li>
	<li>Martial art: The ability to use t‘ai-chi ch‘üan as a form of self-defense in combat is the test of a student's understanding of the art. T‘ai-chi ch‘üan is the study of appropriate change in response to outside forces, the study of yielding and "sticking" to an incoming attack rather than attempting to meet it with opposing force.[11] The use of t‘ai-chi ch‘üan as a martial art is quite challenging and requires a great deal of training.[12]</li>
